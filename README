LLXML2XLIFF
=============

Batch conversion of the core LLXML file to XLIFF

How to
------

1. First update ALL the translation from the translation server (Extension Manager)
2. Open a shell, and launch the command "./llxml2xliff /var/www/sandbox.typo3"
3. The directory "/var/www/sandbox.typo3" must be a valid root TYPO3 path
4. Take a coffee

After the coffee you can found a directory named "Resources/xliff", you can found here all the converted file. If you wont to replace the old LLXML file with the XLIFF file you can use the tools "replacellxml"

  ./replacellxml /var/www/sandbox.typo3
